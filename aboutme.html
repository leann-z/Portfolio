        <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
        <p> 
            As a computer science student, I have a deep interest in various fields, 
            like cyber security (which I have a concentration in), backend development,
             and frontend development. Some of my notable experience includes me being:
             <ul>
                - A summer cyber security intern for the NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration)
            </ul>
            <ul>
                - A cyber scholar for CWIT (Center for women in Technology)
            </ul>
            <ul>
                - A CMSC tutor for a C programming course
            </ul>
            <ul>
                - A research assistant for the human-centered computing department  
            </ul>

            Going forward, I want to improve my skills in the software engineering field by creating more projects that you'll be able to find on my Github!
